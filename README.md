# Smart-Selection-Tool (subject to constant updation)

This project is an AI-based system designed to detect and grade the quality of mangoes using computer vision. It utilizes YOLOv5 for object detection to identify mangoes in images, and OpenCV for feature extraction such as shape, size, and color. The system then evaluates and grades the mangoes based on these visual features, helping to identify the best quality mango. The project includes a user-friendly Tkinter interface that allows users to upload mango images and view the results in real-time. Built using Python, this project demonstrates the power of machine learning and computer vision in improving agricultural practices and decision-making processes.
